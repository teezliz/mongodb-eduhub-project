# EduHub MongoDB Project

## 📚 Project Overview

**EduHub** is a MongoDB-powered e-learning platform database project that simulates a real-world online learning system. The project includes user management, courses, enrollments, assignments, analytics, and system optimization — all fully built using MongoDB and Python.

This project was completed as part of my **Data Engineering Learning Journey** to demonstrate my skills in:

- MongoDB (NoSQL database design)
- CRUD operations
- Aggregation pipelines
- Python (PyMongo)
- Database analytics & optimization
- Project documentation and version control (Git/GitHub)
